The stack .h & .cpp file contains a program that asks a user if they want to add or remove objects from an inventory, while taking and storing the manufacturing date, serial number and lot number. This is accomplished using an inventory class which stores and enables for retrieving data as well as a stack class that can hold objects of the inventory class. A user is asks if they would wish to add or remove a part from their inventory. If they would like to add, they are asks for data about the object and it is then stored in an inventory object and pushed onto the stack. If they woudl like to remove, the program pops the top-most part of the stack and and displays the contents of its member variables. When the user deems the inventory complete, it displays the contents of all the member values of all the objects that remain in the stack.
